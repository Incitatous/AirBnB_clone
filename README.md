##description of the project

This project is a team work done while the authors were students at Holberton School to cover all the fundamentals concepts of the higher level programming track.   
It covers the following fields:  
- A website (call front-end) that shows the final product to everybody
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
